# Project Scope of Works:

## Project Overview
Polyglot is an AI-powered personal language tutor designed to help users learn a new language through interactive conversations, vocabulary drills, and grammar exercises. Leveraging an Agentic AI pattern, the system autonomously guides learners by adapting to their proficiency levels and learning styles. The final solution will be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with an intuitive chat-based interface for seamless interaction.

## Objectives

### üåç AI-Powered Language Learning
- Develop an AI tutor that engages users in conversational learning.
- Generate personalized exercises, quizzes, and feedback to improve learning outcomes.

### üß† Agentic AI System
- Implement an autonomous AI agent that navigates through structured lessons.
- Utilize memory and context awareness to tailor responses based on past interactions.

### ‚òÅ Cloud Deployment & UI Development
- Deploy the AI tutor on Hugging Face Spaces for global accessibility.
- Build an interactive web interface with a chat-based learning environment.

## Scope 1: Beginner Friendly

### Phase 1: Setup (1 Week)
- **Repository & Environment:**  
  - Setup GitHub repository and project folders.
  - Configure virtual environments and install necessary Python libraries.

### Phase 2: Application Logic Development (2 Weeks)
- **LLM Integration:**  
  - Choose a suitable language model (e.g., from OpenAI or Hugging Face) to power the tutor.
  - Integrate the model via API calls to handle user input and generate responses.
- **Content Generation:**  
  - Develop basic routines to generate conversational responses.

### Phase 3: Application UI Development (1 Week)
- **User Interface:**  
  - Build a basic chat-based UI using frameworks like Streamlit or Gradio.
  - Allow users to interact with the AI tutor, input queries, and receive tailored language exercises.

### Phase 4: Deployment (1 Week)
- **Cloud Deployment:**  
  - Deploy the application on Hugging Face Spaces.
  - Ensure smooth integration with the deployment environment and document usage instructions.

## Scope 2: Advanced

### Phase 1: Setup (1 Week)
- **Repository & Environment:**  
  - Setup GitHub repository and project folders.
  - Configure virtual environments and install advanced libraries (e.g., for concurrency, memory handling).

### Phase 2: Application Logic Development (2 Weeks)
- **Agent-Based Architecture:**  
  - Identify and design specific agents for distinct tasks:
    - **Conversation Agent:** Handles interactive dialogue.
    - **Exercise Generator Agent:** Creates personalized drills and quizzes.
    - **Feedback & Context Agent:** Monitors user progress, maintains context, and adjusts difficulty.
- **Custom Orchestration:**  
  - Develop a custom orchestration engine to manage inter-agent communication.
  - Implement memory and context-awareness to tailor interactions based on historical user data.

### Phase 3: Application UI Development (1 Week)
- **Enhanced User Interface:**  
  - Develop an enriched chat-based UI that supports interactive learning and visualizes the underlying agent workflow.
  - Provide controls for users to track progress and adjust learning parameters.

### Phase 4: Deployment (1 Week)
- **Cloud Deployment:**  
  - Deploy the advanced version on Hugging Face Spaces.
  - Ensure smooth integration, scalability, and comprehensive documentation of the deployment process.
